# OutboundAI — Browser-Based Outbound Call Assistant

> Make outbound calls directly from your browser with **role-based auth**, **multi-number calling**, **real-time AI transcription and coaching**, **post-call analysis**, **smart follow-up reminders**, and a **full analytics dashboard** — powered by Deepgram and your choice of Groq or OpenAI.

---

## Features

- **Browser-Based Calling** — Make VoIP calls directly from the browser using Twilio Client SDK. No phone or softphone needed.
- **Role-Based Auth** — JWT login with `admin`/`sales` roles; a bootstrap admin account is created automatically on first startup.
- **Multi-Number Calling** — Admins maintain a pool of Twilio numbers and assign them (many-to-many) to sales users; each outbound call automatically uses the calling user's assigned caller ID, falling back to a default number if none is assigned.
- **Power Dialer** — Select a batch of contacts and auto-dial through them sequentially, with pause/resume/skip and automatic secondary-number retry on no-answer.
- **Real-Time Transcription** — Live speech-to-text via Deepgram streaming (falling back to batched Groq Whisper if Deepgram is unavailable), with a Live Transcript panel shown during the call.
- **In-Call AI Coaching** — Live suggestions (next talking point, objection handling, sentiment, relevant past-project recommendations) as the conversation happens.
- **AI Post-Call Analysis** — Automatic call analysis with sentiment, quality score, action items, and follow-up suggestions.
- **Smart Follow-Up Reminders** — AI suggests follow-up dates, the system parses them into real dates and shows reminders on your dashboard — including for calls nobody answered.
- **Excel Contact Import** — Bulk-import contacts from a spreadsheet, with a country-code selector applied to any number that doesn't already include one.
- **Company Project Knowledge Base** — Upload past project documents (PDF/DOCX); an AI agent extracts domain, tech stack, and summary, and matches them to imported clients for use in live coaching.
- **Analytics Dashboard** — Call volume charts, sentiment breakdown, quality trends, top action items, and AI-generated weekly summaries.
- **Contact Management** — Full CRUD for contacts with status tracking, call history, and notes.
- **Timezone-Aware Timestamps** — API responses convert stored UTC timestamps to the browser's local timezone automatically.

## How It Works

    A[Browser] -->|Login - JWT| A
    A -->|Twilio Client SDK| B[Twilio Cloud]

```

1. You log in (JWT, `admin` or `sales` role)
2. You add/import contacts and click **"Call"** (or select several and start a **Power Dial** session)
3. The browser uses **Twilio Client SDK** to connect the call through Twilio's cloud, identified as you — the backend resolves this to your admin-assigned Twilio number as the caller ID
4. Twilio dials the contact's phone number and streams the audio back to your server
5. Your server streams audio to **Deepgram** (or Groq Whisper as a fallback) for real-time speech-to-text
6. The live transcript and in-call AI coaching suggestions appear in the browser as you talk
7. When the call ends, the configured AI provider (Groq or OpenAI) analyzes the full conversation
8. You get a detailed report: sentiment, quality score, action items, follow-up suggestions
9. If AI says follow-up is needed (or the call wasn't answered), it schedules a reminder on your dashboard

---

## Architecture

Backend code is layered: `routers/` (HTTP/WebSocket only) → `domain/` services and `ai/agents/` → `repositories/` (one per collection) → MongoDB. AI agents never talk to a Groq/OpenAI SDK directly — they go through a shared `LLMProvider` abstraction in `ai/providers/`, so switching providers or models is a settings change, not a code change.

## Call Flow - Step by Step

Complete lifecycle of a call from button click to analysis report. (All `/calls/*` REST calls below require a valid JWT; the diagram omits the `Authorization` header on each request for brevity. `GET /calls/token` mints the Twilio Access Token with your user id as its identity, which `/calls/twiml-app` later resolves back to your admin-assigned Twilio number as the caller ID.)

```mermaid

    participant FE as Frontend (React)
    participant BE as Backend (FastAPI)

## Real-Time Transcription Flow

How audio goes from a phone call to text on your screen. **Deepgram streaming is the primary transcription path** (near-instant, word-by-word) when `TRANSCRIPTION_PROVIDER=deepgram` and a Deepgram key is configured; the diagram below shows the **Groq Whisper fallback path**, used automatically if Deepgram is unavailable, unconfigured, or drops mid-call.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Twilio Media Stream] -->|WebSocket| B[media_stream.py]
    B --> C{Decode base64 payload}
    C --> D[Raw mulaw audio bytes - 8kHz mono]
    D --> E[Buffer for ~3 seconds per track]

    E --> F{Buffer full?}
    F -->|No| D
    F -->|Yes| G[Convert mulaw → PCM 16-bit]

    G --> H[Resample 8kHz → 16kHz]
    H --> I[Check silence - RMS threshold]

    I -->|Silent| J[Skip - return empty]
    I -->|Has speech| K[Build WAV file in memory]

    K --> L[Send to Groq Whisper API]
    L --> M[Receive transcribed text]

    M --> N{Which track?}
    N -->|inbound| O["[Contact Name]: text"]
    N -->|outbound| P["[You]: text"]

    O --> Q[Append to active_calls transcript]
    P --> Q

    Q --> R[Frontend polls /calls/live]
    R --> S[Display in CallPanel UI]
```

### Audio Pipeline Details

| Step | What Happens | Technical Detail |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1 | Twilio sends mulaw audio | 8kHz, mono, base64 encoded in JSON frames |
| 2 | Buffer accumulates ~3s | ~24,000 bytes per track (inbound/outbound) |
| 3 | Convert to PCM | `audioop.ulaw2lin()` — mulaw to 16-bit PCM |
| 4 | Resample to 16kHz | `audioop.ratecv()` — better Whisper accuracy |
| 5 | Silence detection | Skip if RMS < 0.005 (no speech) |
| 6 | Build WAV | Standard WAV header + PCM data, all in memory |
| 7 | Send to Groq | HTTP POST with `whisper-large-v3` model |
| 8 | Label speakers | inbound = contact name, outbound = "You" |

---

## Post-Call AI Analysis Flow

When a call ends, the system automatically analyzes the full conversation.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Call Ends - status: completed] --> B[save_and_cleanup]
    B --> C[Save transcript to MongoDB]
    B --> D["asyncio.create_task(_run_analysis)"]

    D --> E[analyze_call - ai/agents/analysis_agent.py]
    E --> F{AI Provider?}
    F -->|Groq| G[Model from GROQ_MODEL]
    F -->|OpenAI| H[Model from OPENAI_MODEL]

    G --> I[Returns structured JSON]
    H --> I

    I --> J[Analysis Result]

    J --> K{follow_up_needed?}
    K -->|Yes| L[Parse date suggestion]
    L --> M["_parse_follow_up_date()"]
    M --> N["'in 2 days' → datetime(now + 2d)"]
    N --> O[Save: follow_up_date + status: pending]

    K -->|No| P[Save analysis only]

    O --> Q[(MongoDB - call_logs)]
    P --> Q

    Q --> R[Frontend detects analysis ready]
    R --> S[Display in CallHistory]
```

### Analysis Fields

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `summary` | 2-3 sentence overview | "Discussed pricing tiers and timeline..." |
| `sentiment` | Overall call mood | Positive / Neutral / Negative |
| `quality_score` | Agent performance 1-10 | 8 |
| `went_well` | What the agent did right | ["Good rapport building"] |
| `to_improve` | Areas for improvement | ["Ask more discovery questions"] |
| `action_items` | Follow-up tasks | ["Send pricing PDF", "Schedule demo"] |
| `follow_up_needed` | Whether callback is needed | true / false |
| `follow_up_reason` | Why follow-up is needed | "Wants to discuss with team" |
| `follow_up_date_suggestion` | When to call back | "in 2 days", "next week" |
| `key_points` | Topics discussed | ["Budget: $50K", "Timeline: Q3"] |

### Follow-Up Date Parsing

| AI Suggestion | Parsed Date |
|--------------|-------------|
| "today" | Today |
| "tomorrow" | +1 day |
| "in 2 days" | +2 days |
| "next week" | +7 days |
| "in 2 weeks" | +14 days |
| "next month" | +30 days |
| _(anything else)_ | +3 days (default) |

## Follow-Up Reminder System

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[AI Analysis] -->|follow_up_needed: true| B[Parse Date]
    B --> C[Save to DB with status: pending]

    C --> D{User opens Dashboard}
    D --> E["GET /calls/follow-ups/today"]
    E --> F{Any due today/overdue?}

    F -->|Yes| G[Show amber banner on Dashboard]
    G --> H[User expands banner]
    H --> I[See contact list with reasons]
    I --> J{User action}

    J -->|Mark Done| K["POST /follow-ups/{id}/complete"]
    K --> L[Status → completed]
    L --> M[Remove from banner]

    J -->|View All| N[Open Follow-ups Modal]
    N --> O[See all pending with date badges]
    O --> P["Overdue (red) / Today (amber) / Upcoming (blue)"]
```

### How Reminders Work

1. **Dashboard banner** — If follow-ups are due today or overdue, an amber banner shows: *"You have 3 follow-ups due today"*
2. **Expand to see details** — Contact name, phone, and reason for follow-up
3. **Mark as done** — Click "Done" to complete a follow-up
4. **Follow-ups modal** — Click the Follow-ups stat card for all pending follow-ups with color-coded badges:
   - 🔴 **Overdue** — Past the scheduled date
   - 🟡 **Due today** — Scheduled for today
   - 🔵 **Upcoming** — Future date

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+**
- **Node.js 18+**
- **MongoDB** (local or Atlas)
- **Twilio** account with Voice enabled
- **Groq** API key ([console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com))
- **ngrok** ([ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com))

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kumaresan-AI-Engineer/Outbound_Ai.git
cd Outbound_Ai
```

### 2. Backend setup

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv

# Activate virtual environment
# Linux/Mac:
source .venv/bin/activate
# Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Frontend setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### 4. Configure environment

Create `backend/.env` with your credentials (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables)).

### 5. Start ngrok

```bash
ngrok http 8080
```

Copy the HTTPS URL (e.g., `https://xxxx-xx-xx.ngrok-free.app`) and set it as `BASE_URL` in your `.env`. (On Windows, `run.bat` from the repo root automates this whole step via `scripts/sync-ngrok.ps1` — see below.)

### 6. Configure Twilio

1. Go to **Twilio Console** → **Voice** → **TwiML Apps**
2. Create a TwiML App with Request URL: `https://your-ngrok-url/calls/twiml-app`
3. Copy the TwiML App SID to `.env` as `TWILIO_TWIML_APP_SID`
4. Create an **API Key + Secret** in Twilio Console
5. Add them to `.env`

### 7. Run the app

**Terminal 1 — Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

**Terminal 2 — Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Open **http://localhost:5173** in your browser. On first startup with an empty `users` collection, the backend auto-creates a bootstrap admin account from `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAIL`/`BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD` (defaults: `admin@outboundai.local` / `ChangeMe123!`, configurable in `.env`) — log in with that first, then add real users and assign Twilio numbers under **Users**/**Numbers** (admin-only nav items).

### Windows one-click alternative

From the repo root, `run.bat` starts MongoDB, opens the ngrok tunnel, syncs `BASE_URL` + the Twilio TwiML App automatically, then starts both the backend (port 8080) and frontend.

> **Note:** Never commit your `.env` file. It's already in `.gitignore`. `frontend/.env` is only needed to override the API base URL in unusual setups — pointing it at the wrong backend process is a known footgun (see `CODING_STANDARDS.md`/`SESSION_LOG.md`), so leave it unset unless you have a specific reason.
